## Pop Pop Chaos

Sentimental Version: Can almost load bubbles from DB

bcn.robnugen.com/index2.html  = https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3231298
bcn.robnugen.com             = My attempt at Pop Pop Chaos if I visit

Next steps?:

* Try to add colors like index2.html
* Try to add force like index2.html
* Have D3 send bubble create GET requests, perhaps ONE TIME ONLY when setting up the initial game bubbles

* smurf some data per click
* Create endpoints like api/v1/create (to create a bubble)
** Parse bubble creation from D3

Mouseover to repel nodes. Adapted from mbostock's [talk on force layouts](http://vimeo.com/29458354). Compare to the [canvas version](/mbostock/3231307).
